# Features Directory

This directory contains feature-based modules that encapsulate related functionality into cohesive units. Each feature is self-contained with its own components, hooks, API calls, and business logic.

## Purpose

The features directory provides:

- Feature-based code organization
- Self-contained, modular architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy feature development and maintenance
- Scalable application structure

## Architecture Principles

### Feature-First Organization

Instead of organizing code by file type (components/, hooks/, etc.), we organize by features (user-management/, dashboard/, etc.). This approach:

- **Improves Developer Experience**: Related code is co-located
- **Enhances Maintainability**: Easy to find and modify feature-specific code
- **Enables Team Scalability**: Different teams can work on different features
- **Facilitates Code Splitting**: Features can be lazy-loaded independently

### Structure Template

```
features/
├── feature-name/
│   ├── index.ts          # Public API exports
│   ├── page.tsx          # Main page component
│   ├── components/       # Feature-specific components
│   │   ├── FeatureComponent.tsx
│   │   └── FeatureModal.tsx
│   ├── hooks/            # Feature-specific custom hooks
│   │   ├── useFeatureData.ts
│   │   └── useFeatureActions.ts
│   ├── api/              # Feature-specific API calls
│   │   ├── api.ts
│   │   └── types.ts
│   ├── utils/            # Feature-specific utilities
│   │   └── helpers.ts
│   ├── types/            # Feature-specific type definitions
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── constants/        # Feature-specific constants
│       └── index.ts
```

## Current Features

### Feature Template (`feature/`)

A basic template showing the feature structure:

```
feature/
├── page.tsx              # Main feature page
├── api/
│   └── api.ts           # Feature API endpoints
├── components/
│   └── component.tsx    # Feature-specific component
└── hooks/
    └── hook.ts          # Feature-specific hook
```

## Feature Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

- Feature directories: `kebab-case`
- Components: `PascalCase`
- Hooks: `camelCase` starting with `use`
- API functions: `camelCase`
- Types: `PascalCase`

### File Organization

1. **Keep related code together**: Co-locate components, hooks, and types
2. **Clear boundaries**: Each feature should be self-contained
3. **Public APIs**: Only export what other features need
4. **Avoid deep nesting**: Keep directory structure shallow

### Dependencies

- **Shared dependencies**: Use components from `@/components/ui`
- **Feature dependencies**: Minimize dependencies between features
- **External libraries**: Feature-specific libraries should be documented

### Documentation

- Document public APIs and complex logic
- Include usage examples in README files
- Maintain up-to-date type definitions
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
