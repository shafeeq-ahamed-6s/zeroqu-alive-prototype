# Shared Hooks Directory

This directory contains custom React hooks that provide reusable functionality across different components and features in the application.

## Purpose

The shared hooks directory provides:

- Reusable state logic that can be shared across components
- Common patterns for handling side effects
- Abstraction of complex browser APIs
- Centralized logic for common UI interactions
- Integration with external libraries and services

## Structure

```
hooks/
├── useTheme.tsx          # Theme management hook
├── useLocalStorage.ts    # Local storage state management
├── useDebounce.ts        # Debouncing utility hook
├── useAsync.ts           # Async operation management
├── useToggle.ts          # Boolean state toggle hook
├── usePrevious.ts        # Previous value tracking
├── useOnClickOutside.ts  # Click outside detection
├── useKeyPress.ts        # Keyboard event handling
├── useWindowSize.ts      # Window size tracking
└── useIntersection.ts    # Intersection Observer API
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memoization**: Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` appropriately
2. **Dependencies**: Be careful with dependency arrays in `useEffect`
3. **Cleanup**: Always clean up subscriptions and timers
4. **Debouncing**: Use debouncing for expensive operations
5. **Caching**: Implement caching for repeated API calls

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each hook should have one clear purpose
2. **Reusability**: Design hooks to be reusable across different contexts
3. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and edge cases
4. **TypeScript**: Use proper TypeScript types for better developer experience
5. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for all custom hooks
6. **Documentation**: Document complex hooks with JSDoc comments
