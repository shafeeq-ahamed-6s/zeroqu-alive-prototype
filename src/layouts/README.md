# Layouts Directory

This directory contains layout components that provide the structural foundation for different page types and sections of the application.

## Purpose

The layouts directory provides:

- Consistent page structure across the application
- Reusable layout patterns for different page types
- Navigation and header/footer integration
- Responsive layout implementations
- SEO and accessibility optimizations

## Structure

```
layouts/
├── AppLayout.tsx           # Main application layout wrapper
├── AuthLayout.tsx          # Authentication pages layout
├── MainLayout.tsx     # Dashboard and admin layout
├── LandingLayout.tsx       # Marketing/landing pages layout
├── ErrorLayout.tsx         # Error page layout
└── types.ts               # Layout-related type definitions
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Code Splitting**: Lazy load layout components when appropriate
2. **Memoization**: Use React.memo for layout components that don't change often
3. **Virtual Scrolling**: For layouts with long lists or large amounts of content
4. **Image Optimization**: Optimize header logos and background images
5. **Bundle Size**: Keep layout components lightweight
